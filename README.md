This is a decompilation of English Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen that acts as the Unoffical Legacy Game of FRLG.
a QOL if you will

- A Legacy like Style Game with Both Fire Red and Leaf Green that tries to fix the many, many issues of FRLG.
FRLG was one of the first games I ever played, and as I much of do like certain features a lot of decisions were dumb, such as removing cross gen evos.
Kanto itself as a region has a lot of issues present in gen 1, that was kept in the remakes. Like in Legacy, I tried to keep the general feeling intact while making the experience much better. I would say this game is 80% legacy as I did my own things that are a bit far off (such as map changes cause mt moon looks like ass), but it still should be close. 

Documentation: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Mfvqn7awV_FzNYLhpQIl1AKRlfHUGq4F_q_IeZ7K2c/edit?pli=1&gid=1004306526#gid=1004306526

Features:
- All Kanto and Johto Pokemon Available in both Versions
- The Main dex has 181 Pokemon, 30 New Pokemon, 2/3 of which are Evos and Pre Evos, 1/3 are added johto pokemon to strengthen type diversity and johto connection
(Some more may be gotten with secret means)
- Some Maps been changed to look a lot less empty, such as cinnabar island and Mt Moon
- Added Mt Moon Square and a floor under Rock Tunnel, both accessed with rock smash
  
Battle and locationImprovements:
- Trade Evos evolve with either it's trade item or level up
- Improved Pokemon Locations, stats, movesets, and moves (Bug Type Cut, Improved Movesets, Higher Stats, Better Abilities for some) (Nidorans are back on route 22)
- A lot of the pokemon releated locations mirrors Yellow Legacy
- Many Battle Engine and Stat Changes from Emerald Legacy (Ported Directly from EL, but I made my own changes) (50% Boost to defense for hail for instance)
- Dark and Ghost Swapped Types
- Better Trainer Teams (Better Curve, better movesets, mons evolved, giovanni has a rhydon now) (Also includes cross gen evos) (Champion is capped at 65)
- Gift Pokemon are Higher Level
- Many Emerald and Yellow Legacy Features (Fishing Rod Placement, Getting the Fossils, Oak Battles, etc)
- Selectable Difficulty Modes from Legacy (Normal has classic pokemon rules, Hard has lvl caps, no items in battle with set mode, Hardcore has perma death)
- I mainly tried to keep the feel of each pokemon intact and just give improvements to make them just a viable choice and not a liablity. This also allows for better trainer team building
  
Sevii Islands and Postgame:
- Much more Postgame Content (Especially on The sevii islands)
- More Battles 
- There's kinda a Sevii League (A Bunch of boss trainrs to fight) that rewards you with the Aurora Ticket
- Gym leader rematches
- Roamers made much easier to get (Beating the elite four spawns the other roamers assuming you caught the current roamer, they don't roar, they have good ivs, and a npc on Five Island shows you them to put them in the dex. Also this NPC has something)
- Better rewards and items given thoughout the game (Facade Onix Guy gives you a lucky egg now) (Selphy has a chance for master balls)
- VS Seeker Postgame Upgrade (Only takes 1/5 of the steps and gets 100% of all trainers in range)
- National Dex 60 Pokemon requirement removed
- Eggtutor after you beat a certain set of trainers
- A Certain set of trainers from Johto are available to battle
- Catch all 180 Pokemon in the dex, and meet up with oak
- Embark on a Treasure Hunt for Celebi

HMs:
- All Cut Trees and Rocks get removed permanently
- HMs are Replaceable
- Victory Road Boulders stay in place
- Rock Smash added over the Everstone aid with more rocks placed (Optional) Everstone is placed in rock tunnel (Ex: Rock on route 4 that you can break to reach mt moon from cerulean) (Rock Smash can be used after beating Surge)
- TMs got better placement (Hidden Power, Sludge Bomb, Facade are in the game, Locations got more tms like Seafoam has a ice beam tm, thunderbolt in power plant, flamethrower on mt ember)
- Some New Optional Areas Accessed by Rock Smash
- Removed Waterfall Needed use on Four Island (Is just a trophy type item, also dive added as a trophy type island in Safari Zone)

- You can get to the truck without trading (A Certain Pokemon gets Cut at a decently high level at that point) (There's no Mew, but something convenient is there)
- Some NPCs block trees until you beat the SS ANNE Rival
- Beating Misty and Blue also Opens up the dig house (Still Need to get SS Ticket)
- Beat up a guard after getting Vermillion's City Badge to open the gates (Hes pretty overleveled)
